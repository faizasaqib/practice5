Essays are usually written in continuous, flowing, paragraphed text and don't use section headings.<br>
This may seem unstructured at first, but good essays are carefully structured.

Headings can help by keep the reader informed about where they are in the paper:<br>
i.e., headings and subheadings are like directions or signposts that orient the reader.<br>
They may also act as organizing structures for the writer, however: you can always start with headings that you later remove.
